# Raycaster

This is a simple ray casting engine written using C++ and SDL2.

# Overview

This is a typical ray casting engine similar to the one used in Wolfenstein 3D but with the added capability of textured (as opposed to solid colour) floor and ceiling drawing.
The code is written in C++ and uses SDL2 as the rendering backend. The main ray casting algorithm used can be found in this tutorial:
https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html

Lazyfoo.net SDL tutorials were used as an introduction to SDL2:

SDL2, SDL2 image, and SDL2 ttf libraries are required to be setup in order to build the code. Please follow the steps detailed in this page for each:
